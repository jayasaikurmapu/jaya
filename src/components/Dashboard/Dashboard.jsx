      The dashboard of the Employee Management System provides access to the different 
      roles in the organization. The system is designed to support the four main roles: 
      Employee, HR, Finance, and Admin. The Employee role is intended for regular employees 
      who can use the system to view their work schedule, request time off, and check their 
      payroll information. The HR role is reserved for the Human Resources department and allows 
      them to manage employee records, process payroll, and handle employee complaints. The Finance 
      role is intended for the Finance department and allows them to manage the company's finances, 
      process payments, and generate financial reports. The Admin role is reserved for the system 
      administrators who have access to all the system's features and can manage user roles, 
      permissions, and settings. The dashboard provides an easy-to-use interface that allows users 
      to navigate between the different roles and perform their tasks efficiently.
